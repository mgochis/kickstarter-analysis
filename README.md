# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this project is to analize data from several crowdfunding campaigns to help understand what factors will lead in running a successful crowdfunded campaign. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date - The data set shows that on average the best time to start a crowdfunding campaign to ensure the highest probably of success would be to start the campaign in May. June and July are also acceptable times to start the campaign that would still have a high probably of success. The worst times to start a kickstarter campaign would be towards the end of the year; October, November, and December. This is averaged from data collected from 2009-2017 and is showing data from 839 campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals - Campaigns that set goals less than $15,000 had the highest likelihood of success with the highest probably being less than $1,000 with a success rate of 75%. Between $20,000 and $35,000 had the lowest likelihood of success with a failure rate of nearly 80% at their peaks. The most unlikely goals to be successful were goals set above $45,000. There is a range that had a higher chance of success between $35,000 and $44,999, but there were only 9 campaigns ran with that goal range which is not a large enough data set to draw a reliable conclusion.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? The best time to start a campaign is early Summer starting in May. As the summer progresses, the success rate gradually falls until it hits his lowest rates in late Fall and stays poor all through the winter. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? The lower the goal set, the higher likelihood of the campaignâ€™s success.

- What are some limitations of this dataset? We would be able to draw more concrete conclusions if the dataset was larger. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? I would like to see a table of length of campaign vs the outcome of each campaign. I would imagine that the longer the campaign ran the higher likelihood of its success. The amount each campaign went over its original goal may provide some additional information on what type of category backers like to see.
